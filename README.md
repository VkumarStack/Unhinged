# Unhinged
Project 4 for UCLA CS32, Winter 22:

A text-based dating application that, given a file of user profiles listing their attributes (i.e. job)
and values for such attributes (i.e. teacher) matches a specified user with those compatible based on a translator file 
listing pairs of attribute-value keys that are compatible with each other (i.e. a job-teacher may be compatible with 
another job-teacher).

Is able to handle large amounts of data due to complex data structures such as Radix Trees and proper usage of existing 
C++ containers.
